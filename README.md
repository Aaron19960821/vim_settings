## Vim-Settings

This is a vim setting for Yuchen Wang, a dev in Microsoft MMX team.  

### Build

To build this vim setting is very simple:  

First, clone it into your local computer:  

```
https://github.com/Aaron19960821/vim_settings ~/.vim
```

Then open the vim, install the plugins:

```
:PluginInstall
```

YCM may not be enabled after this procedure, we can re-compile it with the following command:

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
python install.py
```

Any questions, feel free to ask me~~
